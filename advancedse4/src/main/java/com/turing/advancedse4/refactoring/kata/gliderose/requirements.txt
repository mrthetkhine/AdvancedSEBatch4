All items have a SellIn value which denotes the number of days we have to sell the item
All items have a Quality value which denotes how valuable the item is
At the end of each day our system lowers both values for every item
Pretty simple, right? Well this is where it gets interesting:

Once the sell by date has passed, Quality degrades twice as fast
The Quality of an item is never negative

The Quality of an item is never more than 50





“Aged Brie” actually increases in Quality the older it gets
“Backstage passes”, like aged brie, increases in Quality as its SellIn value approaches;
Quality increases by 2 when there are 10 days or less and by 3 when there are 5 days or less but
Quality drops to 0 after the concert


“Sulfuras”, being a legendary item, never has to be sold or decreases in Quality
do nothing
